- **API Response Caching**: Reducing database load for common API endpoints
- **CDN Integration**: Static asset caching for product images and media files

## E-Commerce Development Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Complex Product Catalog Management
**Problem**: Managing products with multiple variants (size, color, price) and maintaining inventory accuracy
**Solution**: 
- Designed flexible product-variant relationship model
- Implemented real-time inventory tracking with atomic database operations
- Created efficient product filtering and search functionality with proper indexing

### Challenge 2: Shopping Cart State Management
**Problem**: Maintaining cart state across sessions and handling concurrent cart updates
**Solution**:

- Used database transactions to prevent race conditions during checkout
- Added cart synchronization between frontend and backend states

### Challenge 3: Payment Integration Security
**Problem**: Secure payment processing while maintaining PCI compliance
**Solution**:
- Integrated Stripe Payment Intent API for secure tokenized payments
- Implemented webhook validation for payment confirmation
- Never stored sensitive payment data on backend servers

### Challenge 4: API Performance Under Load
**Problem**: Slow API responses when handling multiple product queries and user sessions
**Solution**:
- Implemented efficient database queries with select_related() and prefetch_related()
- Added Redis caching for frequently accessed product data
- Introduced API pagination and filtering to reduce payload sizes

### Challenge 5: Frontend-Backend Integration
**Problem**: Ensuring seamless data flow between Django backend and Next.js frontend
**Solution**:
- Designed consistent API response formats with proper HTTP status codes
- Implemented CORS configuration for secure cross-origin requests
- Created comprehensive API documentation for frontend developers

## Best Practices & Personal Takeaways

### Code Quality & Architecture
- **Clean Code Principles**: Writing readable, maintainable, and self-documenting code
- **SOLID Principles**: Applying object-oriented design principles for scalable architecture
- **Design Patterns**: Implementing common patterns like Factory, Observer, and Repository patterns
